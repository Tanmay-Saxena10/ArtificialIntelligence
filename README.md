<h1> # 🚗 Driver-Drowsiness-Detection</h1>

Driver drowsiness is a significant factor contributing to road accidents. This project addresses this issue by implementing a Drowsiness Detection system using Python. <br />
Driver drowsiness detection is a project built using Dlib for deep learning based Modules and face landmark detection and OpenCV with Python as a backend language.
The system monitors the video frames to locate the user's face and eyes to detect drowsiness.The system then alerts the user by playing a sound when it detects drowsiness.
  

<h1> 🪄 LOGIC OF PROJECT</h1>

The system captures video from the webcam and processes the frames to detect the user's face and eyes. It then monitors the eyes for signs of drowsiness. If drowsiness is detected, the system alerts the user by playing an alarm sound.
The 68 facial landmark detector is a robustly trained efficient detector which detects the points on the human face using which we determine whether the eyes are open or they are closed.</br>

Determine the drowsiness from these parameters
          <ul><li>Eye blink
          <li>Area of the pupils detected at eyes </ul>
